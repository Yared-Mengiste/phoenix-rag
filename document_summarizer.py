document_summarizer.py
=======================
Generates and caches a concise summary of the source document.

This exists to give prompt_refiner.py real context about what kind of
document this is -- its subject, structure, and the kind of claims it
makes -- so LLM-driven prompt rewrites are grounded in the actual
document rather than generic advice.

Cached the same way question_generator.py caches the benchmark: generate
once, save to disk, reuse on subsequent runs unless forced.
